# Commitment 
### Commitment can be defined as a quality of being dedicated to an action - and in this case I commited to making over 100 git commits and many many pushes to github.

###This project uses a stream-of-consciousness approach (a person's thoughts and conscious reactions to events, perceived as a continuous flow) to create a web page tapestry that incorporates text and css design elements.
